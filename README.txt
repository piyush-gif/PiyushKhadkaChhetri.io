# Piyush Khadka Chhetri's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my projects and skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Machine Learning. Below you will find a brief description of the projects featured on this site.

## Projects

### Data Cleaning in SQL

- **Description:** This SQL script cleans and transforms Nashville housing data for better analysis. It standardizes dates, fills missing property addresses, and splits addresses into separate columns (address, city, state). It also normalizes categorical values (e.g., 'Y' → 'Yes', 'N' → 'No') and removes duplicates using ROW_NUMBER(). Finally, it drops unnecessary columns, improving data quality for analysis.

### Pneumonia Recognition using MONAI

- **Description:** The "Pneumonia Recognition using MONAI" project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images by leveraging deep learning techniques within the MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) framework. The system employs a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model and achieves an accuracy of 80%. A Flask-based web interface allows users to upload images and receive diagnostic results, offering an efficient tool for medical diagnostics.

### Airbnb Dashboard in Tableau

- **Description:** The "Airbnb Full Project" is a Tableau-based data analysis project that examines various aspects of Airbnb listings. The project includes visualizations such as average price per bedroom, number of occupancies for each bedroom, price by zip code, and revenue for the year. These insights can help potential Airbnb hosts make informed decisions about property investments and pricing strategies.

### Bike Buyers Analysis Dashboard

- **Description:** The Bike Sales Dashboard provides insights into customer demographics and purchasing trends. It includes visualizations for average income per purchase, age brackets, and commute distance related to bike purchases. Users can filter data by marital status, region, occupation, and education to analyze different customer segments. This helps businesses identify key factors influencing bike sales.
